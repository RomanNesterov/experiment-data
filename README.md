Compositional discovery of architecture-aware and sound process models of multi-agent systems: experimental data
According to the experiment plan, there is the folder for each interface pattern containing:
1. The reference model (PNML-file)
2. The event log obtained by simulating the behavior of the reference model (XES-file)
3. The model discovered directly from the generated event log (PNML-file)
4. The model discovered by composing the agent model w.r.t. the interface pattern (PNML-file)
